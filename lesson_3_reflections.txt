When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there's a team working, and all the people need access to the files
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If there's many people working, I'll have to accept the changes proposed and only after 
	that do the pull manually.
