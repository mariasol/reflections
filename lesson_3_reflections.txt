When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there's a team working, and all the people need access to the files
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If there's many people working, I'll have to accept the changes proposed and 	only after that do the pull manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork recognizes the work of the creator of a other repository while it
	allows you to make the the copy in a single command.
	Clone is used to copy a repository from a local to local, or from the cloud 	to local.
	Branch is used to create another branch of a repository (locally o cloud 
	stored)with the purpose of experimenting for example.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Email, messenger… Neither of them are efficient.
